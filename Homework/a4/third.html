  <p> Sofia Gubaidulina completed her work on her Duo Sonata for Two Bassoons in 1977, and it was premiered by renowned bassoonist Valeri Popov and his student, Alexander Kochetev on May 17, 1978 in Moscow, Russia.  The piece is full of chant-like sections of music, which grow and contract as such.  Gubaidulina also uses extenive harmonics, multiphonics, fluttertonguinging, and quartertones within the piece to create a unique and thoughtful listening experience. </p>
