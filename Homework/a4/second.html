  <p> Sofia Gubaidulina completed her Concerto for Bassoon and Low Strings in 1975, and it was premiered by Valeri Popov on May 6, 1975. The concerto is unique in that it strays from the traditional concerto model, with the soloist often being equal to the orchestra behind them, which is unusual in a concerto.  The piece is very demanding for the performer, and includes many examples of multiphonics and fluttertonguing.  </p>
